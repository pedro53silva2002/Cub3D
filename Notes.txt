Changelog:

11/02:
	{
		Splited main.c, created draw.c;
		Loading different textures based on direction;
		Added: # define BypassParse 1
	}
	problem: If i look at a image sideways I can see the texture almost complete instead of overlaping

12/02:
Maybe the problem is determining the wall facing direction. its better to understand with the colored walls!

14/02:
{
	trying to render map based on the map design and not player positionn;
	Added new vars to the struct for map dimension;
	Inited those values in the parsebypass;
	
}

15/02:
{
    Merged with Pedro's program;
    Implemented colision;
    Created separated folders for stuff;
	Added Ceelinf and floor color, but is hard coded in main;
    Trying to fix texture overlaping / extension:
        I think I understant the problem.
        The further I am from the textures the more they shrink, the closer I am the more they expand.
        How can I fix this??

		problem is in:
		int calculate_texture_x(t_game *game, int texture_index, float hit_x, float hit_y)
		FIXED!!!
}
16/02:
{
	Debug mode is fked! (What is the problem?)
}
changing - For Debug fix:
void cast_ray(t_player *player, t_game *game, float ray_angle, float *hit_x, float *hit_y, int *side);
int determine_texture_index(t_game *game, int map_x, int map_y, float ray_angle);
draw_line

walls
	I think that the problem is that im determining the texture index based on the position of the blocks next to it, and not the direction each side of the wall is facing.

	What if I do that in a different way?
	Like each wall will have 4 sides, and each side its own texture...

	I "draw a straight line" and check what is the texture beeing put on the outer wall, and the place the oposite one?

	Talvez mudar o mapa, para uma struct que tenha os 4 lados de cada parede identificados?
